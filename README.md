## 🎯 Problem Statement
*Describe the specific pain point or challenge here (Keep it under 3 lines).*
* **Context:** [Context: Students and professionals often struggle to quickly find accurate answers from long PDFs/notes and have to manually search through pages, which wastes time and reduces productivity.]
* **Impact:** [This affects students during exams, learners, researchers, and working professionals who need instant doubt-solving and document-based assistance]

## 💡 Solution
*We built a Gemini-powered Voice + PDF Assistant that allows users to upload PDFs/notes and ask questions using text or voice. The assistant generates accurate answers from the PDF context and responds in both text and speech, making learning and information retrieval fast, interactive, and accessible..*
1.  **Key Point 1:** [PDF-Based Q&A: Upload PDFs and get context-based answers (no random hallucinations).]
2.  **Key Point 2:** [Voice Input: Ask doubts using speech (Speech-to-Text).
]
3.  **Key Point 3:** [Voice Output: AI replies with natural voice (Text-to-Speech).]
